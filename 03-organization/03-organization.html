## Face it

- There are going to be files

- LOTS of files

- The files will change over time

- The files will have relationships to each other

- It'll probably get complicated

---

## Mighty weapon

- File organization and naming is a mighty weapon against chaos

- Make a file's name and location VERY INFORMATIVE about what it is, why it exists, how it relates to other things

- The more things are self-explanatory, the better

- READMEs are great, but don't document something if you could just make that thing self-documenting by definition

# Organizing your data analysis workflow

---

## Raw data to data

Pick a strategy, any strategy, just pick one!

~~~
data

data-raw
data-clean

data/
  - raw
  - clean
~~~

---

## Data to results

Pick a strategy, any strategy, just pick one!

~~~
code

scripts

analysis

bin
~~~

---

## There is no one formula

that will work for all projects, but use an organization that will allow

- you to come back to the project a year later and resume work fairly quickly

- your collaborators to figure out what you did and decided and what files they need to look at

---

## Tips

- Use a `from_joe` directory: Suppose your collaborator and data producer is Joe. Just leave communucation and files from Joe in this directory and copy or symlink as needed and record this in the project README.
--

- Give yourself less rope: Revoke write permission to the raw data file.
--

- Use a directory for communication that doesn't have to follow naming guidelines
--

- Keep the life cycle of data in mind
  - get raw data
  - explore, describe and visualize it
  - diagnose what this data needs to become useful
  - fix, clean, marshal the data into ready-to-analyze form
  - visualize it some more
  - fit a model or whatever and write lots of numerical results to file
  - make tables and figures based on the data &amp; results accumulated by this point
