# Reproducible Computing

Short-course at [ISBA 2018](https://bayesian.org/isba2018/Short-Courses/)  
2018-06-24  
9am - 5pm

## Abstract

Success in statistics and data science is dependent on the development of both analytical and computational skills. This workshop will cover:

- Recognizing the problems that reproducible research helps address.
- Identifying pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible.
- The role of documentation, sharing, version control, automation, and organization in making your research more reproducible.
- Introducing tools to solve these problems, specifically R, RStudio, RMarkdown, git, GitHub, and make.
- Computational reproducibility specific to Bayesian methodologies.

Workshop attendees will work through several exercises and get first-hand experience with using relevant tool-chains and techniques, including R/RStudio, literate programming with R Markdown, automation with make, and collaboration and version control with git/GitHub.

### Literate programming and organization (9:00 - 10:30)

- Recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address and identify 
pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible.
- The role of documentation, sharing, automation, and organization in making 
your research more reproducible.
- Literate programming with R Markdown
  - Introduce the data: Gapminder
  - Hands on activity: Updating an analysis when the source data changes
- Project organization
  - File and folder organization for projects
  - Naming conventions

### Version control with Git and GitHub (11:00 - 12:30)

- What is Git and version control?
- Git in GitHub
  - Define git vocabulary (commit, fork, pull request, repository, commit 
  message).
  - Demonstrate ability to navigate through a Github repository main page.
  - Define the difference between a directory and a repository.
  - Create a repository on GitHub.
  - Demonstrate ability to commit changes to text files with a commit message.
  - Evaluate repository History.
  - Create a pull request to someone else's repository.
- Git in RStudio
  - Define git vocabulary (push, fork, local repository, remote repository)
  - Fork remote repository from Github into RStudio.
  - Navigate through the basics of using git in RStudio.
  - Push local repository from RStudio to Github.
  - Demonstrate the ability to host code from RStudio to Github.

### Scaling reproducible projects + Make (14:00 - 15:30)

- Practical example - Scottish lip cancer
  - Reproducible R Markdown document with "full Bayesian analysis" including data munging, EDA, model fitting and analysis.
- Caching as a solution to scaling
  - Build your own cache: Saving your own results with `save()` vs. `saveRDS()`
  - R Markdown caching: `cache = TRUE`
- Using make to automate and scale
  - Introduce make
  - Review make syntax
  - Introduce hands on exercise - adapt 

### Hands on exercise + Q&A (16:00 - 17:00)

- Finish up hands-on exercise + Live demo
- Local installation
- Q&A

## Computing requirements

- R - 3.5.0
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) - 1.2.707 or higher
- git
  - OSX - install Git for Mac by downloading and running the installer or install homebrew and use it to install git via brew install git.
  - Unix / Linux - you should be able to install git via your prefered package manager (e.g. apt, dnf, yum).
  - Windows - install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). This will provide you with git, the bash shell, and ssh in windows.

    - rstan
    - sf
  - From github:
    - tidybayes: https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes
