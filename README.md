# Reproducible Computing

Short-course at [ISBA 2018](https://bayesian.org/isba2018/Short-Courses/) . 
2018-06-24  
9am - 5pm

## Abstract

Success in statistics and data science is dependent on the development of both analytical and computational skills. This workshop will cover:

- Recognizing the problems that reproducible research helps address.
- Identifying pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible.
- The role of documentation, sharing, version control, automation, and organization in making your research more reproducible.
- Introducing tools to solve these problems, specifically R, RStudio, RMarkdown, git, GitHub, and make.
- Computational reproducibility specific to Bayesian methodologies.

Workshop attendees will work through several exercises and get first-hand experience with using relevant tool-chains and techniques, including R/RStudio, literate programming with R Markdown, automation with make, and collaboration and version control with git/GitHub.
