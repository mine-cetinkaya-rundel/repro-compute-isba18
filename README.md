# Reproducible Computing

Short-course at [ISBA 2018](https://bayesian.org/isba2018/Short-Courses/)  
2018-06-24  
9am - 5pm

## Abstract

Success in statistics and data science is dependent on the development of both analytical and computational skills. This workshop will cover:

- Recognizing the problems that reproducible research helps address.
- Identifying pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible.
- The role of documentation, sharing, version control, automation, and organization in making your research more reproducible.
- Introducing tools to solve these problems, specifically R, RStudio, RMarkdown, git, GitHub, and make.
- Computational reproducibility specific to Bayesian methodologies.

Workshop attendees will work through several exercises and get first-hand experience with using relevant tool-chains and techniques, including R/RStudio, literate programming with R Markdown, automation with make, and collaboration and version control with git/GitHub.

### Literate programming and organization (9:00 - 10:30)

- Recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address and identify 
pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible.
- The role of documentation, sharing, automation, and organization in making 
your research more reproducible.
- Literate programming with R Markdown
  - Introduce the data: Gapminder
  - Hands on activity: Updating an analysis when the source data changes
- Project organization
  - File and folder organization for projects
  - Naming conventions

### Version control with Git and GitHub (11:00 - 12:30)

- What is Git and version control?
- Git in GitHub
  - Define git vocabulary (commit, fork, pull request, repository, commit 
  message).
  - Demonstrate ability to navigate through a Github repository main page.
  - Define the difference between a directory and a repository.
  - Create a repository on GitHub.
  - Demonstrate ability to commit changes to text files with a commit message.
  - Evaluate repository History.
  - Create a pull request to someone else's repository.
- Git in RStudio
  - Define git vocabulary (push, fork, local repository, remote repository)
  - Fork remote repository from Github into RStudio.
  - Navigate through the basics of using git in RStudio.
  - Push local repository from RStudio to Github.
  - Demonstrate the ability to host code from RStudio to Github.

### Scaling reproducible projects (14:00 - 15:30)

- Introduce the data: Scottish lip cancer
- Demo R Markdown document with full analysis including EDA, model fitting with 
`rstan`, trace plots, and predictive checks.
  - Using chunk labels to identify R chunks that take a long time to run
- Caching as a solution to scaling
  - R Markdown caching: `cache = TRUE`
  - Build your own cache: Saving your own results with `save()` vs. `saveRDS()`
  - Drawbacks of these approaches: not aware of when updated
- Using make to automate and scale
  - Introduce make with a toy example of a paper
  - Review make syntax
  - Hands on exercise: Translate the (more complex) R Markdown document on 
  Scottish lip cancer into a project that uses make

### Automation with make (16:00 - 17:00)

- Finish up hands-on exercise
- Live demo of solution to exercise
- Q&A
