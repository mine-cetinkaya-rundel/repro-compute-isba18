# Reproducibility: who cares?

## Science retracts gay marriage paper without agreement of lead author

- In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway 
people's opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months earlier.

- Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: Original survey data not made 
available for independent reproduction of results. + Survey incentives 
misrepresented. + Sponsorship statement false.

- Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study quickly 
discovered that the data must have been faked.

- Methods we'll discuss today can't prevent this, but they can make it 
easier to discover issues.

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

## Divorce study felled by a coding error gets a second chance

- **Original conclusion:** The risk of divorce in a heterosexual marriage increases when the wife falls ill, but not the husband. 

- **Corrected conclusion:** Based on the corrected analysis, we conclude that there are not gender differences in the relationship between gender, pooled illness onset, and divorce.

## Divorce study retraction: Editor's note

- "The research environment is fast-paced given the ethos to “publish or perish"."

- "[...] research is becoming increasingly complex, with greater calls for transdisciplinary collaborations, “big data,” and more sophisticated research questions and methods [...] data sets often have multiple files that require merging, change the wording of questions over time, provide incomplete codebooks, and have unclear and sometimes duplicative variables."

- "Given these issues, I would not be surprised if coding errors were fairly common [...]"

# Reproducibility: why should you care?

---

## Think back to every time...

- The results in Table 1 don't seem to correspond to those in Figure 2.
- In what order do I run these scripts?
- Where did we get this data file?
- Why did I omit those samples?
- How did I make that figure?
- "Your script is now giving an error."
- "The attached is similar to the code we used."

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## No collaborators?

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&gt;Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, &lt;br&gt;
but you don’t reply to emails.

# Reproducibility: how?

---

## Reproducibility checklist

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how 
were parameter settings chosen?)
- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

---

## Ambitious goal + many other concerns 

We need an environment where

- data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, 
inseparable

- reproducibility is built in
    + the original data remains untouched
    + all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

- documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal

## Toolkit

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## Roadmap

1. Scriptability `\(\rightarrow\)` R

2. Literate programming `\(\rightarrow\)` R Markdown

3. Version control `\(\rightarrow\)` Git / GitHub

4. Scaling and automating `\(\rightarrow\)` make
