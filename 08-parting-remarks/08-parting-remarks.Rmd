## R Markdown tips / resources

- R Markdown cheatsheet: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/
- R Markdown document should be in your root directory
- Do not set a working directory in your R Markdown document
  - Actually, don't ever use `setwd()`
  - See the `here` package for an alternative approach

## GitHub tips / resources

- It's pretty easy to convert your repo to a website
  - Go to Settings and then Enable GitHub pages
- You can use GitHub as a search engine to see how people write their `Makefile`s and how they use functions in a given language
- You can add a license to your repo upon creation or later by adding a file called LICENSE.md
  - GitHub provides you a list to select licenses from
  - Think about commercial/non commercial, share alike/not
  - See https://choosealicense.com/ for help with picking a license

## Make tips and resources

- Some projects you can outline well initially and start with a Makefile
- Others you'll want to start working in an R Markdown document and then break it up into pieces and use Make o put everything back together
- Thinking about the folder structures we discussed in the organization will help
